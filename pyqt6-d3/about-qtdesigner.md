## Steps to follow

1. Select a form – In the New Form dialog,
choose from one of the available templates, 
Main Window, Widget, or a type of Dialog. 
You can also add and preview widgets to include in your GUI.

2. Arrange objects on the form – Use Qt Designer’s drag-and-drop
mechanics to place widgets on the form. Then assign layouts to
containers and the main window.

3. Edit the properties of objects – Click on the objects in the form
and edit their features in the Property Editor dock widget.

4. Connect signals and slots – Use the Signals/Slots Editing mode to
link signals to slots.

5. Preview your GUI – Examine the form before saving it as a UI file
with the .ui extension.

6. Create and edit Python code – Utilize the pyuic compiler to
convert the UI file to readable and editable Python code.
